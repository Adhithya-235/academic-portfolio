Hello! I'm Adhi, a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of New Hampshire. I use dynamical systems theory, model reduction methods (both asymptotic and data-driven), and high-performance numerical simulations to understand the mechanisms behind emergent structure in turbulent geophysical flows. My work engages with a range of topics, including Langmuir turbulence, quasigeostrophic point vortex dynamics, and strongly stratified turbulence.
